It has the ring of a classic American narrative\u2014or would, at least, if that ring weren\u2019t drowned out by the arena-filling shrieks of excited concertgoers. For the Jonases, the journey certainly is \u201cabout reconnecting with our amazing fans, who have waited patiently for three years to hear new music from us\u201d\u2014as they said in announcing their upcoming tour\u2014but to some extent, it\u2019s also about reconnecting with each other. Since the release of their last album, 2009\u2019s <i>Lines, Vines, and Trying Times</i>, the Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum-selling siblings have each taken slightly different trajectories as they\u2019ve flown from the Disney nest. Joe launched his blues-rock solo project, Kevin starred on the reality TV show <i>Married to Jonas</i>, and Nick conquered Broadway as the star of <i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The theme song to this reunion is the explosive new single \u201cPoms Poms.\u201d Drenched in marching-band horns and a pyrotechnic backbeat, the song\u2019s sizzle signals the trio\u2019s maturation from teen-pop icons to man-pop icons while whetting fans\u2019 whistles for their upcoming 2013 album. The new tour promises to crackle with the energy of a Pop Rocks\u2013and-soda cocktail as the Brothers grace the stage with sure-footed choreography and fraternal harmonies in a set of past and future greatest hits.</p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gl-live-nation-national-274/confirmation?pledge_id=6891396","maximumPurchaseQuantity":8,"discountPercent":25,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"100+","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$40.00","amount":4000},"initialQuantity":0,"title":"Aug. 13, 2013 at 7 p.m.: One Ticket to Jonas Brothers Live Tour, Bleacher Sec. 201-212","redemptionLocations":[{"streetAddress2":"","neighborhood":"","postalCode":"94105","country":"US","phoneNumber":"","lat":37.805333,"name":"America's Cup Pavilion","state":"California","id":6547174,"streetAddress1":"27 Pier","city":"San Francisco","lng":-122.401082}],"bookable":false,"specificAttributes":{},"discount":{"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$10.00","amount":1000},"details":[{"description":"Limit 8 per person. <b>G-Pass not redeemable with mobile app. </b>\u00a0Use for admission at America's Cup Pavilion on 8/13.

Freestanding <a href=\"http://gr.pn/12JxmqJ\">studio cabins</a> provide ample space for families for four and are equipped with a full kitchen and cable TV.</li>\n<li>You can venture into town to grab dinner, or borrow one of the lodge\u2019s barbecues to grill your own meal. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gr.pn/uCvkoG\">Yosemite National Park</a> is less than two hours\u2019 drive away.

The area is rife with outdoor activity no matter the season, but it\u2019s particularly vibrant during the summer months. At nearby Pinecrest Lake, you can fish, hike, swim, and boat during the day, and catch an after-dark flick at the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/10TNHUW\">Pinecrest Amphitheater</a>. With hundreds of miles of dirt trails and four mountain passes, Long Barn is also a popular destination for both on- and off-road motorcycle riding. </p>\n\n<p>There are also two recommended day trips within a two-hour drive of Long Barn. Two hours east is Bodie, one of California\u2019s most famous ghost towns. Once a gold rush-era boomtown with more than 65 saloons, Bodie was deserted in the early 20th century. Today, it\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=509\">State Historic Park</a> that\u2019s open to the public with 100 well-preserved structures. </p>\n\n<p>Less than 90 miles south of Long Barn lies the entrance to <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose\">Yosemite National Park</a>, which welcomes millions of annual visitors. Spring is one of the best times to see the park\u2019s famed <a href=\"http://gr.pn/yIyEnS\">waterfalls</a>, thanks to the snowmelt brought on by warmer weather. Yosemite Falls\u2014a three-tiered waterfall that\u2019s considered North America\u2019s highest\u2014transforms into thundering cataracts each spring. Serious hikers can trek to the top on the strenuous <a href=\"http://gr.pn/sogXkR\">Upper Yosemite Falls</a> trail, which gains 2,700 feet in elevation in just 3.5 miles.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-long-barn-lodge#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","isSoldOut":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"accessType":"featured","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/wgUhGKqwp8FsWiYXdeiR/t460x279/po-960x582.jpg","says":{"websiteContentHtml":"<p>Everybody knows that rhymes such as \u201cLiquor before beer, you\u2019re in the clear; beer before liquor, never sicker\u201d keep drinkers from getting sick.

Perched on a bluff overlooking the Caribbean Sea, the resort offers a range of distinctly grown-up indulgences, including four hot tubs, an onsite spa, and a discreet, clothing-optional area.</p>\n\n<p>The decor is a blend of Mediterranean and traditional Mayan influences. Grecian columns and thatched roofs surround the hot tubs and a separate infinity pool, where water cascades down a stepped wall and seems to reach all the way to the ocean. All-inclusive privileges grant access to a slew of onsite <a href=\"http://www.adonistulum.com/restaurants-bars-en.html\">restaurants</a>. El Nopal serves upscale Mexican cuisine in a dining room adorned with vibrant folk tapestries, and Asian fare is prepared at Kamasutra, where a wall of windows overlooks the pool.</p>\n\n<p>You can enjoy drinks after dark at one of the resort's swanky lounges. At Spirit Night Club, soft lavender lights illuminate mod barstools as servers sling inventive cocktails and DJs spin dance tunes into the wee hours. At the end of the day, retire to your luxurious Partenon suite to cool off with a rainfall shower or unwind in the in-room jacuzzi. The resort also has a <a href=\"http://www.adonistulum.com/spa-en.html\">spa</a> where you can get pampered with an organic body treatment or a couples massage.</p>\n\n<h4>Riviera Maya: Rich with History and Tropical Calm</h4>\n\n<p>Just south of Playa del Carmen, the ancient Mayan seaport of <a href=\"http://gr.pn/olWynK\">Tulum</a> overlooks the Caribbean from white beaches and rocky bluffs. The inhabitants of Tulum\u2014which means \"walled\" in Mayan\u2014first erected the city's outer fortress to protect themselves from belligerent tribes. Today, visitors can traipse from the beach to the city's ancient ruins, which include temples and a cliff-side castle.</p>\n\n<p>A scenic drive brings you to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula's legendary limestone cenotes, freshwater sinkholes created by an underground river system. At the Cenote Cristalino, intrepid visitors jump from terraced outcroppings into the exposed pool or go snorkeling in the underwater caves. At this popular weekend hangout, you can watch locals expertly flip, dive, and synchronized cannonball into the clear water.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-adonis-tulum-riviera-maya-gay-resort-spa#tabs-2\">Read the Fine Print</a> for important info on travel dates and other restrictions.</em></p>","options":[{"expiresInDays":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-adonis-tulum-riviera-maya-gay-resort-spa/confirmation?pledge_id=6902108","maximumPurchaseQuantity":6,"discountPercent":74,"status":"open","soldQuantityMessage":"0","externalUrl":null,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"value":{"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$3,404.00","amount":340400},"initialQuantity":0,"title":"Option 1: Four nights in a Partenon suite","redemptionLocations":[{"streetAddress2":"","neighborhood":"Riviera Maya, Mexico","postalCode":"77780","country":"Mexico","phoneNumber":"","lat":20.188505,"name":"","state":"","id":6556683,"streetAddress1":"Carretera Tulum Boca Paila Km 3.8; Carretera Federal Playa-Tulum","city":"Tulum","lng":-87.442589}],"bookable":false,"specificAttributes":{},"details":[{"description":"Book by 6/7/13 or promotional value expires.

In Greek, <em>Akribos</em> means \u201cexact and precise;\u201d XXIV are the Roman numerals for 24, as well as Prince\u2019s latest signature. Taken together, the name both pays homage to the past and makes a promise for the future. Each timepiece the company crafts is meticulously designed to track all 24 hours in a day. Furthermore, every watch doubles as an eye-catching accessory.
